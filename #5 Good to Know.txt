In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int myNum = 5; 		    //stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double myDoubleNum = 9.98;  //stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
float myFloatNum = 5.99;    //floating point number
char myLetter = 'D'; 	    //stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string myText = "Hello";    //stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool myBoolean = true;	    //stores values with two states: true or false

The data type specifies the size and type of information the variable will store:
Data Type	Size		Description
int		4 bytes		Stores whole numbers, without decimals
float		4 bytes		Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 7 decimal digits
double		8 bytes		Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean		1 byte		Stores true or false values
char		1 byte		Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values

Syntax
type variable = value;
Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variable is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
